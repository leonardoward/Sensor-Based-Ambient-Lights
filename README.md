# HELA MODULE
PG-7232 Embedded Systems - Project Sprint 2

This project contains the firmware and simulation of a prototype of ambient lights. It contains a PIC16F1768 to manage all the digital signals. This repository a [MPLABX](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/development-tools-tools-and-software/mplab-x-ide) project, with the source code for the microcontroller (the folder Hela.X). It also contains a [Proteus](https://www.labcenter.com/simulation/) project  used to simulate and test the electronic design.

The design is a modular system that allows the user to multiple usage modes for an [110V/220V LED Strip](https://es.aliexpress.com/item/1005001989354694.html?spm=a2g0o.productlist.0.0.15731814f4HM3v&algo_pvid=82597dfd-2696-4544-87ad-ca4784616c1c&algo_expid=82597dfd-2696-): they can be turn on/of manually or automatically depending on a the time of the day or the amount of light in the environment.
