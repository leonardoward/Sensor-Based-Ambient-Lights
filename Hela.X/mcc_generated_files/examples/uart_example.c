\brief This file contains sample source codes to demonstrate the UART Foundation Services APIs.

For this example application to work the following needs to be done:
1. Configure the EUSART module as follows:
    - Enable EUSART: ticked
    - Enable Transmit: ticked
    - Enable Receive: ticked
    - Enable EUSART Interrupts: ticked
    - Redirect STDIO to USART: ticked
    - Configure other settings as desired.
    - Select TX and RX pins in Pin Manager: Grid View.
2. Connect the board to a laptop serial port.
3. Open a serial port terminal application (i.e. PuTTY or TeraTerm)
4. Configure the serial port application to the following settings:
    - Baud Speed: same as the UART configuration
    - Data: same as the UART configuration
    - Parity: none
    - Stop bits: same as the UART configuration
    - Flow control: none
    - Receive: Carriage Return
    - Transmit: Carriage Return
    - Local Echo: On
5. Call UART_example_<USE_CASE>() from main().   

This example works like this:
1. Upon reset, the application will display "START" to test UART_Write function.
2. The program will then print the following to test printf support:
    Hello World! 1\n
    Hello World! 2\n
    Hello World! 3\n
3. The program will then display "Receive test: Type a message then press enter (max 16 chars):"
4. Type a message no longer than 16 characters.
5. The program will then print "You typed:" and echo back your message. This will ensure that the UART_Read function is working.
6. If everything is working fine, the program will print "OK."

Note: To test other instances, feel free to modify this file.
